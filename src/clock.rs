//! The server's clock. An offset simulates an identity provider whose clock runs ahead of (or
//! behind) real time: it shifts the timestamps written into tokens and every expiry check
//! (codes, sessions, refresh tokens, `max_age`, ...). It lives in memory only, so a restart
//! always goes back to real time.
